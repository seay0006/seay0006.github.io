        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/image_of_me.jpeg" alt="image of me">
      <p>My name is <em>Colin Seay</em>, I am the first born and eldest of a family of farmers. I was born and raised just south east of a small town in rural ottawa called sarsfield. My family raised cattle and did cash cropping throught most of my young life, however after my parents split I ended up no longer in a farming environment and instead living split between Limoges and Orleans. The contrast between city life and country life was quite jaring as a young kid, firstly being able to see other people all the time was something that I didnt know I wanted until I had recieved it and by that same testament the amount of stores and shops active was mind bogling.</p>

      <p>In the current day I am someone with a natural talent from grasping tech, though that is mainly due to my love for understand what makes things tick. Over the last 3 years I have spent an awfully long time taking apart computers and reassembling them so that i knew what made them run and how the connections between the pieces worked. I approach humans the same way and I love finding out what it is that makes peoples brain operate. This helps me in my favourite hobby,<abbr title="Table Top Role Playing Games">TTRPGS!</abbr></p>

    <p>Here is a quote from an anime called <cite>Gurren Lagann</cite><blockquote> "If you cant believe in yourself, believe in the me that believes in you"</blockquote> This quote has shown me a mentality that i have applied to my day to day life.</p>
        
    <p>The most overrated math equation in my opinion is a<sup>2</sup>+ b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></p>
